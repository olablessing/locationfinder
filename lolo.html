    reviews
    are
    still
    the
    first
    thing
    that
    comes
    to
    a
    person’s
    mind
    when
    considering
    the
    sharing
    stage
    in
    the
    travel
    lifecycle,
    however
    recent
    technological
    and
    behavioral
    developments,
    especially
    in
    the
    generation
    x
    and
    the
    millennial
    generation,
    are
    indicating
    a
    significant
    change
    in
    the
    tourism-­‐related
    sharing
    behavior.</p>
